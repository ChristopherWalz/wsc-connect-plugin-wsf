# WSC-Connect Extension: Native WSF/WBB support
Feel free to submit pull requests to improve the plugin.

Requirements
------------
This plugin requires the [WSC-Connect Plugin](https://github.com/ChristopherWalz/wsc-connect-pluginF) and the Woltlab Suite Forum.

Your instance has to be accessible without security features like `.htaccess`/Basic Auth; this means you can't use this plugin within your testing environment if you're using commercial products by WoltLab within the same installation.

Take part
---------
You can [register your own WSC-Instance](https://www.wsc-connect.com/register) right after you installed the plugin into your WSC.

You want to get more information? Check the [FAQ](https://www.wsc-connect.com/faq) or send us an email to hello@wsc-connect.com.
